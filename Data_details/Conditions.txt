Conditions

Probabilities for conditions: 

A report from the Public Health Agency leverages the 2017â€“2018 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) shows that 73% of adults 65+ have at least 1 of 10 common chronic conditions: Hypertension (65.7%), Periodontal Disease (52%), Ischemic Heart Disease (27%) Diabetes (26.8%), Osteoarthritis (25.1%), Cancer (25.1%), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (20.2%), Asthma (10.7%), and/or Mood or anxiety disorders (10.5%). Conservative estimates indicate that about 37% of seniors report having at least two of the ten common chronic diseases.

Hypertension (65.7%):
Relevant data: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, medication intake.

Periodontal disease (52.0%):
No directly mapped health data in this set.

Osteoarthritis (38.0%):
Relevant data: pain location, pain level, and exercise type.

Ischemic heart disease (27.0%):
Relevant data: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, exercise data.

Diabetes (26.8%):
Relevant data: glucose level, medication intake, and meal contents.

Osteoporosis (25.1%):
Relevant data: pain location, pain level, and exercise type.

Cancer (21.5%):
No directly mapped health data here.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (20.2%):
No directly mapped health data here.

Asthma (10.7%):
No directly mapped health data here.

Mood & anxiety disorders (10.5%):
Relevant data: mood tracking (happy, contempt, sad, angry), medication intake, and sleep quality.

Notes:

Mood tracking is not exclusive to mood or anxiety disorders, but it is expected to be more prominent or relevant in these groups.

Pain and exercise data are broadly relevant to many chronic conditions, not exclusive to osteoarthritis.

Medication intake is a broad indicator applicable across multiple conditions.

Some conditions like periodontal disease, cancer, COPD, and asthma are not specifically tracked by the current dataset variables.
